# Growing Food and Power Together: Soilless Agrivoltaics for India

**Presented at the World AgriVoltaics Conference, 2025**

India faces a familiar challenge: the same land we depend on for food production is increasingly needed for renewable energy generation. This work explores whether hydroponic agriculture and solar photovoltaic systems can occupy the same space without forcing farmers to choose between them.

Instead of treating greenhouses and solar arrays as competing land uses, this research asks a practical question:

**Can the same piece of land grow lettuce and generate electricity at the same time, and remain economically viable for small farmers?**

## Research Focus

This work evaluates the feasibility of co-locating soilless lettuce cultivation under photovoltaic structures in India. It examines:

- Water use efficiency in hydroponics compared to conventional agriculture  
- Energy requirements of climate-controlled soilless farming  
- Land productivity when both food and electricity are produced on the same site  
- Financial viability under smallholder constraints  
- A proposed digital-twin decision framework for managing crop growth and energy use  

The analysis combines engineering models, agricultural resource metrics, energy profiling, and basic techno-economic assessment.

## Key Insights

**PV structures do not replace agriculture; they can support it.**  
Hydroponic farms benefit from shading and microclimate moderation provided by PV arrays, while PV modules benefit from plant-driven cooling effects.

**Soilless systems significantly improve water efficiency.**  
Hydroponics requires substantially less water per kilogram of produce, making it appropriate for regions where irrigation scarcity limits agricultural potential.

**Dual land-use systems increase revenue stability.**  
Co-production of electricity and high-value crops distributes financial risk and offers more predictable income streams compared to standalone agriculture or standalone solar.

**Digital-twin methods can improve farm operations.**  
Basic sensing and data-driven control can optimize climate management in response to irradiance, crop stage, and PV energy generation.

## Conceptual Framework

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| IoT sensing | Measures environmental variables and energy flows |
| Yield forecasting | Predicts growth and harvest cycles |
| Control logic | Modulates climate control based on PV output and crop needs |
| Photovoltaic system | Provides energy, structure, and shading |

This framework is intended as a scalable starting point for rural agrivoltaic deployment with soilless agriculture in India.
